Everything here was created and committed by Daniel Bailey, in the process of 
learning whatever language I happened to be working on that day. Generally, 
I'm following along with a book, using code samples and projects laid out in 
the book and/or creating my own projects based on samples and lessons I'm 
working through. 

Feel free to use anything you find helpful. Shoot me a message if I can help
out with anything. And of course keep in mind that as I write this in February 2019, 
I'm pretty new to all this (if it's not obvious from the code). 

Also, you can follow me everywhere @CodeBueno
